**The [Progression-of-EDLD-652-Final Repo](https://chhr1s.github.io/Progression-of-EDLD-652-Final/) contains all of the past iterations of these figures, as required by the final project. Note that past iterations used "harsh" punishments, which is a broader category than exclusionary. This was changed for consistency with the majority of the literature; of note, the findings did not change appreciably.**

### Introduction

**Background**

As a former teacher and a prevention scientist, I can say disciplinary actions are given to students inequitably; sometimes this can be chalked up to circumstantial differences, but often it's due to biases carried by the administration.

Such inequities manifest as [Black students recieving a disproportionate number of "exclusionary" disciplinary actions](https://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/viewFile/2787/1911), compared to their other racial-ethnic counterparts—particularly White students. 

"Exclusionary disciplinary action" is any action which removes a student from the school (e.g., suspension, expulsion, etc.). Such exclusionary punishments are shown to [contribute directly to the school-to-prison pipeline](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10665684.2014.958965). This is not meant to be a deep-dive into the literature, but this [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C38&q=inequity+in+student+discipline&btnG=) link can get you started if you're interested. 

**Current Project**

This dashboard is an exploratory analysis of inequity in **exclusionary punishments** among demographic characteristics in Georgia schools, defined as: 

  * Expulsion (permanent or impermanent)
  * Out of school suspension
  * Juvenile court referral
  * Being removed and assigned to an alternative school
  
**Data**

The data set represents over 2,000 schools in nearly 200 districts across the state of Georgia, and merges data from the [Governer's Office of Student Achievement](https://gosa.georgia.gov/report-card-dashboards-data/downloadable-data) and the [Georgia Department of Education](https://www.gadoe.org/data-reporting/Pages/default.aspx) over 4 academic years, beginning in 2015.

Single imputation was used for all models, as pooling multiple imputed data sets is not interpretable to the target audience (and is not integrated into mixed effects regression trees). Imputation was done with the `{mice}` package with all variables included in the data set. Missingness in state-reported data stems from districts which had numbers too small to report. As previously stated, the data can be seen on Page 2

### Neural Network

I trained a [neural network](https://chhr1s.shinyapps.io/Neural_Net_Predictions/) with 3 years of data to predict the number of exclusionary punishments at a school. The model allows you to input your own values for all parameters with sliders and drop down menus (except year which is fixed to 2015). 

**By changing only a few variables at a time, you can see the relative impact of a given variable or the interactive effect of a few**

The model was tuned with k-fold cross validation where k = 4, and final evaluation was done with the next year's data. The model defaults to the average of each value for each parameter, and chooses the first school on the list. 

Note that this allows you to make some impossible projections (e.g., 100% Black students & 100% White students & 100% Hispanic students; selecting a school and a different district which doesn't house that school; selecting high school by name and seeing what would happen if it were an elementary school, etc.). For that reason, good logic should be used in its interpretation. Eventually, I'll improve the user interface and allow the year to be changed. I might even prevent impossible combinations, but not yet. Code for the final neural net was:

### Figure 2 Explanation

**How exactly do schools who give many exclusionary punishments per student compare to those who give very few?**

**Figure 2** compares demographic characteristics for schools with the fewest (i.e., bottom 10%) and most (i.e., top 10%) exclusionary punishments per student.

Schools who give the fewest exclusionary punishments per student have a fairly even spread of % FRL students, often have low % Black students, and have high % White students. Schools who give the most exclusionary punishments per student almost exclusively have high % FRL students, high % Black students, and often low % White students. 

This necessitates both a deeper investigation into the equity in use of these exclusionary punishments and exploration of possible alternative punishments that allow students to learn from mistakes in a school setting. Teachers and Administration in districts with such demographics should examine the way that they — and their coworkers — interact with low-income and Black students. 

Simple recommendations include: 

  * Blind review of punishment-worthy incidents and their respective punishments. 
  * Formation of a larger panel — including student representatives and people of color — to handle disciplinary actions. 
  * Use of evidence-based strategies for disciplinary action which have been shown to change student behavior, rather than simply removal from school ground.
  * Focus on rehabilitative action, rather than punitive action.
  * Incorporation of an equity framework to punishment.
  * Choosing leadership strategies that can close the racial discipline gap.
  * Reading important literature on [the problem](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1021320817372.pdf), [appropriate leadership styles](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00098655.2015.1121120), etc.

### Description 

**What test was conducted?**

Parameter instability tests are relatively infrequently used tools in education, probably because their long-standing inability to take into account nested data structures (like those made by schools nested in districts). Recent advancements from [Zeileis, Hothorn, and Hornik's (2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/106186008X319331) general linear model regression trees have extended them to incorporate such nesting, thanks to [Fokkema & Zeileis (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29071652/). Such models are extremely powerful and flexible. They use recursive partitioning to find subgroup differences in any regression model, as well as determining which variables moderate the relationship specified to varying degrees. 

These models allow you to specify a mixed-effect model and provide partitioning variables. After accounting for level-2 variance, the model runs many linear models and determines which parameters differ along partitioning variables. A variant of an *F* test is then used to determine if differences among partitioning variables are significant at a pre-specified alpha, controlling for inflation with Bonferroni corrections. If these differences are significant, subsequent splits can be identified, which would suggest an interactive effect. When variables appear higher in the tree, they are "more important" to the model, meaning that variable creates more homogeneous subgroups than those below. 

**How was missing data handled and how was the model specified?**

Single imputation was used to fill missing data. The model shown here only reports group differences at the *p* < 0.001, after Bonferroni corrections, a max depth of 3, and with the minimum acceptable node as as 200 schools/node (i.e., just under 10% of sample). The model was estimated with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with the `{glmertree}` package. 

An intercept-only model was fit for exclusionary discipline per student at the school level. Random intercepts were fit with school types nested within districts. The model explored for parameter instability across level-1 and level-2 with all school- and district-level covariates (e.g., percent racial/ethnic composition, percent FRL status, percent English second language, and percent migrant students). To control for dependencies, variances of school types (elementary, middle, etc.) were specified to be nested within their districts.

### Results

**Figure 3** shows results of this exploratory model. The tree reads as a decision tree, establishing which schools are in the leave nodes. The leaf nodes essentially read as boxplots for the subgroup specified by the tree. 

The variable which shows the greatest inequity in exclusionary punishments per student is school type, with middle and high schools displaying higher average exclusionary punishments per student than elementary and K-12 schools.

Among these groupings of school types, the variable which creates greatest instability in estimation of the intercept is percent Black students. In both cases, schools with higher percent black students had many more exclusionary punishments than schools with lower percent Black students. Finally, within middle and high schools with more than 52% Black students, the percent of FRL eligible students let to further inequity in exclusionary punishments (with schools with more than ~75% FRL eligible students having more exclusionary punishments than those with less)

An important note here is that the figure actually shows the entire distribution across elementary and middle schools, but many outliers for middle and high schools were omitted from this visualization to make comparison of the average and interquartile ranges easier.

The model predicts:

Middle and high schools with **less than 52% Black students** average just over **1 exclusionary punishment for every 5 students**.

Middle and high schools with **more than 52% Black students** averaged just under **1 exclusionary punishment for every 2 students**.

Elementary and K-12 schools with less than 54% Black students average just over **1 exclusionary punishment per every 10 students**.

Elementary and K-12 schools with more than 54% Black students, average more than **1 exclusionary punishment per every 5 students**.

This provides evidence that there is significant inequity in distribution of exclusionary punishments per student across schools type (e.g., middle and high school vs. elementary schools and K-12) and percent Black students. While we can chalk up differences in school type to many factors that are reasonable (e.g., inappropriate discipline styles at early ages, types of offenses at different ages, etc.), we cannot say the differences in average exclusionary discipline by racial characteristics is reasonable. Next steps should explore interventions which can improve administrative decision-making to minimize such inequity and to conduct student-level analyses on disciplinary data.
